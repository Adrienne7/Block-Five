Introduction to Graphs - Important data structure and is used in so many different algorithms.

Graph API - The Data Structure that we will use to create Graphs. It stores a Bag of adjacent vertices for each vertex.

.
Depth First Search Algorithm - Great to see if you can get to a vertex from another Vertex. The graph must be undirected.

Connected Components API - Checks quickly if there is a way to get from one vertex to another vertex in a undirected graph. Checks if two vertex are in the same connected component.

Breadth First Path Algorithm - Used for undirected graphs to find the shortest path from one vertex to another vertex.

PriorityQueue - These give us a quick way to obtain the max or min value. Since it stores these in A[1]. Max PQ stores the max at A[1] and a Min PQ stores the min at A[1]

BinaryHeap - We have two Binary Heap implementations that both implement the Priority Queue.  There is a max and a min version.
